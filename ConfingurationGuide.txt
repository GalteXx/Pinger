All configurables are stored in ipConfig.cfg
You can configure:
Inner and outer IPs
Firewall rule switch (optional)

This is how strings are binded
#Inner IP (should be something like "192.168.1.1")
#Outer IP (google.com by default)
#Name of firewall rule (set it to "false" in order to prevent button from appearing)
#Default action to sync rule state (1)


(1) There is no way to get if rule is on or off by code, so app just turns on/off the rule.
(1) If this rule is SUPER IMPORTANT, choose wisely (I am not responsible for damage it might deal)
(1) "On" or "Off" are supported. If set to Off software will turn rule off when launched. If On than on

Config will reset itself to default if broken. If FW configuration is broken it will display a warning and turn switch off
